This short article provides an overview of the steps needed to configure NordVPN from the command line on Ubuntu 20.04.

### Contents
{% include toc.html %}

### Installation
Installing and configuring NordVPN is explained in detail [here](https://support.nordvpn.com/Connectivity/Linux/1325531132/Installing-and-using-NordVPN-on-Debian-Ubuntu-Elementary-OS-and-Linux-Mint.htm).

### Commands
Useful commands;

Type `nordvpn settings` to display the current settings.

Type `nordvpn status` to provide details relating to the current connection.

Type `nordvpn connect` to connect to a random NordVPN server. You can choose to connect to specific countries, so for example 'nordvpn connect United_Kingdom' will connect you to a server in the UK.

Type `nordvpn countries` to see a list of the available countries.

Type `nordvpn disconnect` to disconnect you from the server.

## Switches
To change the settings;

Type `nordvpn set killswitch on` to enable the killswitch.

Type `nordvpn set cybersec on` to enable cybersec.

To switch from OpenVPN to NordLynx, use the command `nordvpn set technology nordlynx`. Replace 'nordlynx' with 'openvpn' if you want to switch back.

### Activate at Login
I am using the i3 window manager. I have added the following line to `~/.config/i3/config` the result of which will be to make the connection to a NordVPN server in the UK automatically at login.

```c
exec --no-startup-id nordvpn connect United_Kingdom
```
