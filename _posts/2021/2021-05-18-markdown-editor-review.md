Having used the Atom editor for some months now, it is apparent there are some packages I no longer need. I have also discovered additional packages that make the editing process altogether more efficient.

I have removed;
1. Markdown-writer by zhuochun
2. Toolbar-markdown-writer by zhuochun
3. Markdown-to-pdf by jooola

The packages I now utilise are;
1. Language-markdown by burodepeper
2. Markdown-preview-enhanced by shd101wyy
3. Platform-ide-terminal by platformio
4. Wordcount by nesQuick
5. Spell-check by atom
