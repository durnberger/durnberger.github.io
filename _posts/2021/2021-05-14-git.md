A few useful Git commands to get you started.

<!--more-->

Having set up my [Github profile](https://github.com/durnberger), I've had to learn a few basic commands. The official [Github Docs](https://docs.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/getting-started-with-git) is very helpful, and got me on the right track.

### Personal Details
To set your username for every repository cloned to your computer;

```bash
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
```

To set your email address;

```bash
git config --global user.email "your.email@address.co.uk"
```

To ensure the correct information has been stored,

```bash
git config --list
```

### Cloning
To quote from [Github](https://docs.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/github-glossary#clone),

> A clone is a copy of a repository that lives on your computer instead of on a website's server somewhere, or the act of making that copy. When you make a clone, you can edit the files in your preferred editor and use Git to keep track of your changes without having to be online. The repository you cloned is still connected to the remote version so that you can push your local changes to the remote to keep them synced when you're online.

To clone a repository, first change directory into the directory that will hold the copy of the repository on your computer;

```bash
cd ~/location/your/directory/
```

Then run the command;

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-github-name/your-repository.git
```

A copy of the repository will now be downloaded to your selected directory.
