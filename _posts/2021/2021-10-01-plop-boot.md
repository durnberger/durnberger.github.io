  What do you do if you want to install a new OS, but your computer can't boot from a DVD or USB?

What do you do if the CD/DVD drive on your old computer is broken, and you want to install
Linux to it? What if your computer can't boot from a USB stick and you can't locate a floppy
disk for love nor money? Never fear, PLOP is here!

A ridiculous name but it is really rather clever. It will allow you to boot into your OS from a hard drive, CD, floppy or USB, bypassing the BIOS.

The requisite software and detailed instructions can be found
