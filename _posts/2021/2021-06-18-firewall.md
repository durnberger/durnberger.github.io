For my own reference a few of the basic commands relating to the use of Ubuntu's Uncomplicated Fire Wall (UFW).

In each case replace `[port number]` with the numeric value of the port you want to open (allow) or close (deny).

1. Allow Access
```bash
sudo ufw allow [port number]
```

2. Deny Access
```bash
sudo ufw deny [port number]
```

3. Allow Access from a Specific IP Address
```bash
sudo ufw allow from 192.168.0.1 to any [port number]
```

4. Start, Stop and Restart the Service
```bash
sudo systemctl [start | stop | restart] ufw
```
