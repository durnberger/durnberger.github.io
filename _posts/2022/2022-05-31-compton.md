Compton. A screen compositor that won’t sacrifice speed and responsiveness

<!--more-->

As [www.maketecheasier.com](https://www.maketecheasier.com/speed-up-linux-desktop-with-compton/){:target="_blank"} explain, *Compton is a super-lightweight standalone compositor designed to be used in conjunction with Linux desktops. Perfect for older hardware, it is often used by lightweight distros that need a compositor that won’t sacrifice speed and responsiveness*.

On a Ubuntu based system, installing Compton is as easy as;

```
sudo apt install compton
```

If like me, you wouldn't know where to start to create the config file, you might also want to install `compton-conf`, which provides a user friendly GUI with which to generate the necessasry config file. The file will be saved to `~/.config/compton.conf`.

An alternative is to use one of the config files made available by some of the generous souls at [Github Gist](https://gist.github.com/starred){:target="_blank"}. I am presently using one created by [Nam Dinh](https://gist.github.com/namdinh95){:target="_blank"}, which you can find [here](https://gist.github.com/namdinh95/d820519782b7287a3392fc2f4e210d8e){:target="_blank"}. It is working a treat on my machine.
