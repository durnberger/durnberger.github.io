  How to use HTML to create sub- and superscript.

Imagine you're writing about someone who is 5foot 9 and a quarter inches in height.

Written numerically, 5' 91/4", which does not look right.

To ensure the quarter displays correctly, type the following;

```
5' 9<sup>1</sup>/<sub>4</sub>"
```

The result looks like this: 5' 9<sup>1</sup>/<sub>4</sub>".

A lot tidier!
