How to merge several PDF's into one document.

<!--more-->

To convert several PDf's into one PDF document, we can use `pdfunite`. This is a part of `poppler-utils`, which can be installed using the following command;

```
sudo apt install poppler-utils
```

To merge the documents, run the following, changing the pdf file names as necessary;

```
pdfunite 1.pdf 2.pdf 3.pdf output.pdf
```
