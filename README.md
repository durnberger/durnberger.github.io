## About
I have been a keen amateur photographer for more years than I can remember. It all started with an old second-hand Fuji. From there I progressed to Minoltas and a superb Pentax ME-F. I have been taking digital shots since the early 2000's. Presently I shoot with either a Canon 7D or Fujifilm X70, although I have taken  a step back into the world of analogue, shooting 35mm with a Pentax ME-Super and medium format using an old Lomo Lubitel 166b.

More often than not I shoot landscapes and urban scenes, but every now and then I return to the subject that was my introduction to photography, aircraft.

I am also very interested in Linux and Ubuntu in particular. I use **this blog** to record what I have learnt whilst creating an environment suitable for a photographer utilizing, wherever possible, free and open source software. I presently use Ubuntu and the i3 window manager on my PC. I have built a simple home server which also runs Ubuntu.

Finally, if you want to find out more about my photography you can find me via any of the following links;
